          A range of psychological and communications theories have been used to
          explain how commercial sponsorship works to impact consumer audiences.
          Most use the notion that a brand (sponsor) and event (sponsoree)
          become linked in memory through the sponsorship and as a result,
          thinking of the brand can trigger event-linked associations. Cornwell,
          Weeks and Roy (2005)[2] have published an extensive review of the
          theories so far used to explain commercial sponsorship effects.
